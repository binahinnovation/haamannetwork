# Virtual Account Funding Issue - Solution Guide

## Problem Description
Users are experiencing an issue where funds deposited via virtual account are not showing up in their dashboard balance, even though the transaction history shows the deposit was successful.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue appears to be related to the real-time subscription not properly updating the wallet balance in the frontend state when the database is updated by the webhook.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Real-time Subscription
- **Improved logging**: Added console logs to track real-time updates
- **Better error handling**: Enhanced error handling in the subscription
- **Unique channel names**: Using user-specific channel names to avoid conflicts
- **Type safety**: Improved type handling for numeric values

### 2. Manual Refresh Functionality
- **Dashboard refresh button**: Added a refresh button next to the balance visibility toggle
- **Wallet page refresh**: Enhanced existing refresh functionality
- **Loading states**: Added proper loading indicators

### 3. Enhanced Webhook Logging
- **Detailed logging**: Added comprehensive logging in the webhook handler
- **Balance tracking**: Log previous and new balance values
- **Error tracking**: Better error messages and logging

### 4. Debug Tools (Development Only)
- **Test wallet update function**: Created a test edge function to manually trigger wallet updates
- **Debug button**: Added a test button in development mode to test wallet updates
- **Console logging**: Enhanced logging throughout the system

## Files Modified

### Frontend Changes
1. **src/pages/DashboardPage.tsx**
   - Added refresh button with loading state
   - Added development-only test button
   - Enhanced error handling

2. **src/store/authStore.ts**
   - Improved real-time subscription with better logging
   - Enhanced error handling and type safety
   - Added unique channel names per user

### Backend Changes
1. **supabase/functions/flutterwave-webhook/index.ts**
   - Added comprehensive logging for debugging
   - Enhanced balance update tracking

2. **supabase/functions/test-wallet-update/index.ts** (New)
   - Test function to manually trigger wallet updates
   - Useful for debugging real-time subscription issues

## Testing Steps

### 1. Test Real-time Subscription
1. Open browser developer console
2. Navigate to dashboard
3. Look for "Real-time subscription initialized" message
4. Make a virtual account deposit
5. Check console for "Real-time profile update received" messages

### 2. Manual Testing (Development)
1. In development mode, you'll see a "Test" button next to "Add Money"
2. Click the test button to simulate a wallet update
3. Check if the balance updates in real-time
4. Check browser console for detailed logs

### 3. Manual Refresh
1. If balance doesn't update automatically, click the refresh button (â†») next to the eye icon
2. This will manually fetch the latest balance from the database

## Troubleshooting Guide

### If Real-time Updates Still Don't Work
1. **Check browser console** for any JavaScript errors
2. **Verify Supabase connection** - ensure environment variables are correct
3. **Check network tab** for failed requests
4. **Use manual refresh** as a temporary workaround

### If Webhook Isn't Being Called
1. **Check Flutterwave webhook configuration**
2. **Verify webhook URL** is pointing to the correct Supabase function
3. **Check Supabase function logs** for incoming webhook requests
4. **Verify webhook signature** (currently disabled for testing)

### Database Issues
1. **Check RLS policies** on the profiles table
2. **Verify user permissions** for updating wallet balance
3. **Check for database triggers** that might interfere

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Logs to Monitor
1. **Supabase Function Logs**: Check for webhook processing errors
2. **Browser Console**: Monitor real-time subscription status
3. **Database Logs**: Check for failed balance updates

### Regular Checks
1. **Test virtual account deposits** regularly
2. **Monitor user complaints** about balance issues
3. **Check webhook delivery status** in Flutterwave dashboard

## Future Improvements

### Short-term
1. **Add webhook signature verification** for security
2. **Implement retry mechanism** for failed webhook processing
3. **Add user notifications** for successful deposits

### Long-term
1. **Implement webhook queue system** for reliability
2. **Add comprehensive audit logging** for all balance changes
3. **Create admin dashboard** for monitoring webhook health
4. **Add automated testing** for webhook functionality

## Emergency Procedures

### If Users Report Missing Funds
1. **Check transaction history** in admin panel
2. **Verify webhook logs** for the specific transaction
3. **Manually update balance** if webhook failed
4. **Contact Flutterwave support** if needed

### If System-wide Issues
1. **Check Supabase status** and function health
2. **Verify Flutterwave API status**
3. **Enable manual balance refresh** for all users
4. **Communicate with users** about temporary issues
